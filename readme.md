### API details

Following names are directly linked to the eponymous resource and are URL paths for the HTTP API endpoint with corresponding methods.

1. `user`

   1. `POST` - Access Level (AL) 5. Accepts JSON encoded body with all fields of the resource `User`. Field `email` is required, field `id` is ignored. Upon success returns the identifier of the user and emails activation link. If the field `name` is not provided it should be filled automatically with a simple funny name.
   1. `GET` – AL 4. Has parameter `id`. Returns json object with all fields that have equal or lower access level. Unregistered users get response 401. Users that share a party also get the field `games`. Owner of the account additionally get the field `email`.
